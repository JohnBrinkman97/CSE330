### Creative ###

Added a function to make other users admins that can ban and kick but cannot ban other admins. 

### issues ###

room messages and direct messages may not work if the user is the creator of a room, but should worlk for anyone else in the room. We are not sure why this is happening,
and could not fix it in time. We believe it has something to do with the way a creator of a room joins the room vs. the way another person joins that messes something up
