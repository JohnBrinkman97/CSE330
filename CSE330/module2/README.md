File Sharing site 
link to site: 
http://ec2-52-15-51-119.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~john.brinkman/FileShare.html

### Creative Portion ###
For the creative portion, we made it so that the users can share files with other users. The file will be copied into the other person's file directory(stays in original person's as well) 
The user must type in the exact name of the file as well as the username of the friend. 
The file must already be on their site, not just on their computer in order to share.
